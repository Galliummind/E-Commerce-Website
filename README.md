# E-Commerce Website
 This was an assignment website to create an e-commerce website for selling refurbished computers.
This was my first ever attempt at self taught programming and a project I have made from scratch. 
Please note the cart section isn't anything to boast about, but I created this so I could familiarize myself with 
local storage and how it would work across multiple browsers. In the future I would like to make a more utility based 
website where I take advantage of the vast libraries and APIs available to build an actual website, rather than 
make everything from scratch.
